# tensorFlowFaceDetection Project
## Overview
This project harnesses the capabilities of machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect human faces from photographs and real-time video. Specifically, it employs bounding box augmentation and the deep object detect model. The project also leverages VGG16, a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep and has been pre-trained on over a million images from the ImageNet database.

## Features
- Personalized Face Detection: Train the model specifically on your face. Once trained, the system can identify and highlight your face in images and videos.
- Real-time Video Face Detection: Activate your camera and experience the system detecting your face in real-time, overlaying a live feed with highlighted bounding boxes around detected faces.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to and open the FaceDetection.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions and execute the code cells in the notebook to set up and run the face detection system.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow

## Future Enhancements
- Enhance detection accuracy, especially in challenging lighting conditions.
- Expand the system to detect and highlight multiple facial features, such as eyes, nose, and mouth.
- Optimize the system for seamless real-time performance, especially on mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.
