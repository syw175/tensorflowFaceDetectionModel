# tensorFlowFaceDetection Project
## Overview
This project is designed to detect human faces from photographs and real-time video. Leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision techniques, it can accurately identify and highlight faces in various scenarios.
I have used bounding box augmentation, deep object detect model and leveraged VGG16, a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep and pre-trained on a million images from ImageNet.

## Features
- Train the model to detect your face and the system will identify and highlight your face if it is present.
- Real-time Video Face Detection: Turn on your camera and watch as the system detects your face in real-time, providing a live feed with highlighted faces.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the FaceDetection.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
- Follow the instructions and code cells in the notebook to set up and run the face detection system.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- (Any other libraries or dependencies used in the notebook)

## Future Enhancements
Improve detection accuracy in low-light conditions.
Add support for detecting multiple facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).
Optimize for real-time performance on mobile devices.
